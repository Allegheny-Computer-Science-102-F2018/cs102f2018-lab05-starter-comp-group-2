# Sudoku Puzzle Solving Algorithms

## Intro

Sudoku is a puzzle game in which the board is set up into a three by three grid containing nine sub-regions.  Each of these sub-regions then contains another three by three grid.  As it may be a little hard to understand, an example of the standard puzzle is provided in the image below.  The puzzle is considered solved when each of the nine sub-regions contains one unique number (one through nine), as well as each column and row also containing only one unique number.  Although the number of sub-regions and sub-region components are able to be much larger in more complex puzzles.

Our proposed project examines two algorithms used to solve Sudoku puzzles.  The algorithms mentioned in the next section take two different approaches to the solving of Sudoku puzzles.  As such, we plan on examining these algorithms by subject of time to complete puzzles given different inputs, as well as looking at why these algorithms may have different efficiencies with our limited knowledge.  We will accomplish examination by first implementing the algorithms in Python as well as providing different input into each algorithm.  The output will then be a completed puzzle as well as a time to complete.  To ensure that time taken is standardized for both algorithms, we will place the line of code containing the timer directly at the start of the main loop for both programs.
