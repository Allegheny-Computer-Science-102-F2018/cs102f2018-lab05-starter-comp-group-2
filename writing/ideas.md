### Idea 1
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

A study of the use of web scrapers in data accumulation.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

The use of web scrapers to gather data is very common in computer science and
there are many different tools that already exist. The main one for Python is
BeautifulSoup, but still has its limitations.

*A primer on theory-driven web scraping: Automatic extraction of big data from the Internet for use in psychological research*

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The central idea of the article is the exploration of web scrapers and their
uses in different areas, mainly psychology.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article discusses the creation and use of both a web scraper and crawler to
gather data as well as its use in psychology.
