For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

The study of the use for symbolic mathematics

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

Symbolic math is key to aid in the understanding of different computational expressions.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465517303028

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

 A program that performs the factorization of dimensionally regulated poles in parametric integrals, and the subsequent numerical evaluation of the finite coefficients. It also creates a library of the integrated functions, such that it can be linked to user-specific codes for the evaluation of matrix elements in a way similar to analytic integral libraries using python packages.


5) How will this article support your idea?
It is reliant on python and the use of symbolic math in order to create manipulations of symbolic math in order to create a new expression of integrals.

### Idea 2
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

Utilizing text and frequency analysis.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

It utilizes tools given to us as computer scientists to aid in a real world application

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1470785318758558


4) What is the central thesis to the article?

Using text analysis in order to find trends of the market and utilizing predictions to create a better sense of quantitative and qualitative market research

5) How will this article support your idea?
It deals with the idea of taking words and parsing through the different ideas in order to better develop an idea of trends or themes in given books or data analysis.


### Idea 3
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

The idea is to create a KenKen puzzle solver.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

In computer science algorithms are frequently used to accomplish a variety of tasks such as searching or sorting. In order to solve the KenKen puzzle, we would have to create an algorithm.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
